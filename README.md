# Customer-Satisfaction-using-Olist-Dataset
End to End Project

All Data analysis, preprocessing, data visulaization, EDA and feature enginnering is done in EDA and feature engineering notebook.

Modelling including design of various models using Machine Learning models suitable for this project is done in the Modelling notebook.

I have also done comparision of all the models and tabulated the results.

For a better picture of comparision how conventional ML based models stand to Basic/Standard Deep Neural Network model, there is a comparision to that as well.

Finally, the best model is stored into a pickle file.

End to end pipeline is created which will just take the test data, predict the output using pipeline function named function1 and print results,show plots of various performance metrics using the pipeline function named function2.

Hope you find it usefull!!
